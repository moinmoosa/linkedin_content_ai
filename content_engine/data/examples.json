      "content": "Ever wondered why a behemoth like Meta (earlier Facebook) is encountering frequent outages with WhatsApp? What\u2019s the real reason behind them? And is it time to switch to a more reliable platform?\n\nIt\u2019s the second time in less than a year that Meta\u2019s services have suffered a global blackout. In Oct 2021, all three platforms \u2013 Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp \u2013 suffered a nearly 7 hr outage, followed by the recent outage of WhatsApp in India for nearly 2 hrs affecting more than 500 Mn users.\n\nAccording to a recent analysis by Bloomberg, Meta\u2019s biggest bet of $19 Bn, WhatsApp could wind up more valuable as a sacrifice to regulators than as a viable business.\n\nKey Reasons:\n1) WhatsApp\u2019s role as an earnings void than a money maker like Instagram, while WeChat \u2013 another messaging competitor in China \u2013 generated upwards of $500Mn in June 2022 alone\n2) Limited clarity on turning WhatsApp into a viable Business Model \u2013 First by trying to monetize the app with Ads and then by charging businesses to engage with customers\n3) Zuckerberg's changing vision \u2013 first from privacy-oriented social networking in March 2021 to an immersive world of Metaverse in just 7 months\n\nAdditionally, Zukerberg\u2019s primary motive for buying WhatsApp was to fend it off as a competitive threat, and the recent mounting pressure from Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to divest WhatsApp and Instagram concretely explains Zuckerberg's lack of drive to invest and improve his biggest bet.\n\nQuickly closing the chapter on WhatsApp might highlight an unsettling truth for Meta\u2019s investors but it seems the investors' community has already spotted it, and the same is getting reflected in Meta\u2019s stock price - The company can\u2019t seem to make money from anything other than traditional online advertising.\n\nPS: Factors like Apple\u2019s Ad tracking feature and rising competition in the attention market from TikTok, Youtube, Netflix, etc. are also playing a significant role in the decline of the stock price of Meta.\n\nWhat do you think are some of the other reasons and what the future holds for WhatsApp and Meta?\n\nhashtag#business hashtag#india hashtag#meta hashtag#whatsapp hashtag#outage",
